# Road Condition Prediction Based on Weather Data
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict road conditions (Snow/Ice, Wet, or Dry) using real-time weather data. It leverages machine learning to help forecast road conditions based on factors such as temperature, precipitation, wind direction, and wind speed. This is especially useful for the automotive industry, road safety agencies, and weather-related services to enhance traffic safety and driving conditions.

The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, which is trained on historical weather data. The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for inputting weather parameters and getting real-time road condition predictions.
